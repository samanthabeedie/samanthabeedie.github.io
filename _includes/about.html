                <h2>What I Do</h2>
                <p>I'm a versatile tattooist and enjoy working in colour as well as black and grey. Each piece I tattoo is customised and personal to you. I never tattoo the same piece twice.</p>
                <p>I work from <a href="https://www.thismortalcoiltattoogallery.co.uk/" target="_blank">This Mortal Coil Tattoo Gallery</a> a small studio of world renowned artists in Altrincham. It's easily accessible by train, bus or tram.</p>
                <p>Whether it's a new piece, an addition to your existing tattoos or a cover up. Feel free to contact me with your ideas.</p>
                <p>I also create artwork for prints and commissioned, one off pieces in a range of mediums.</p>
